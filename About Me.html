<h3>The Biography of God</h3>
	<p>I'm a student at ACTVF and am apart of the graduating class of 2019 this year. Also, I'm 17 years old and will be 18 later this year. So far i've had one stable job that i've thouroughly enjoyed. When I get to college I'm not sure in what I would like to major in, but i'm not concerning myself to much over it. I would most likely like to become a teacher of some sort and busy myself making small games on the side as a hobby with whatever I learn this year in AP Computer Science.</p> 

	<p>I have a pet cat at home called Luna that I rescued after somebody was threatening to throw her in a trash compactor, i've had her for 4 years now and will keep taking care of her from now on. Some hobbies of mine are reading, playing video games, drawing, and eventually making small scale games. </p>

<h3>Techonology BLESSED by God</h3>
	<p>On a somewhat daily basis I use my phone and more frequently I use my computer. I mostly use them to browse the internet and I play games on my computer.</p>
